FA = fastball
FF = four-seam fastball
FT = two-seam fastball
FC = fastball (cutter)
FS / SI / SF = fastball (sinker, split-fingered)
SL = slider
CH = changeup
CB / CU = curveball
KC = knuckle-curve
KN = knuckleball
EP = eephus

SO FAR WHAT I GOT: 

take the pitchers percentage of throwing each pitch --> from the 'Pitch Type' table
take the pitchers avg amount of runs given up per 100 pitches of each pitch and multiply it by the percent that pitch is thrown
ex:
     Jacob deGrom:   FB% 62.6, SL% 25.8, CH% 11.6
    runs given up:      1.86,     3.10,     4.38
            total:      (1.86 x .626) + (3.10 x .258) + (4.38 x .116) = 2.47 runs saved per 100 pitches

take the batters avg amount of runs produced per that pitch
ex:
        Mike Trout:    wFB/C: 4.94, wSL/C: 2.88, wCH/C: 5.88
             total:    (4.94 x .626) + (2.88 x .258) + (5.88 x .116) = 4.517 runs per 100 pitches against Jacob deGrom? 
             
             
        total:    (-3.49 x .626) + (2.80 x .258) + (1.69 x .116) = -1.2663 runs per 100 pitches against Jacob deGrom? 

do this calculation for each batter.. add it all up and divide by 9 to get the lineup expected runs against Jacob DeGrom pitch mix.
