    - maybe pitcher vs batter stats

Can do WOBA against for Pitchers: 
    For pitchers, of course, the opposite is true: the lower the opposing wOBA, the more effective the pitcher has been.


WOBA Rule of Thumb

Excellent	    .400
Great	        .370
Above Average	.340
Average	        .320
Below Average	.310
Poor	        .300
Awful	        .290



Add up team WOBA average for away lefty or home righty or whatever the combo is 
See which team us higher WOBA vs their pitcher matchup combo 
Also add up and average for last 14 days 

—-
Pitchers see which ones have lower WOBA vs the batters using their combos - first do home / away
Then see how many lefties they facing and how many righties - need to average their WOBAs for this 
See which pitcher has lower WOBA 

—- 

Can easily calculate if pitcher has an advantage and lineup has advantage let’s go 

---

ORDER:
first need to see if pitcher is home or away / lefty or righty
get their home / away woba based on whatever they are

then add up how many lefties / righties they are facing - Switch hitters will be the opposite of what they are. 
woba formula: ((WOBA v Lefties * num lefties) + (WOBA v Righties * num Righties)) / 9 --> player against WOBA

so now we have the pitchers away / home and lefty / righty

- as we are looping through the players, we can do all of their away WOBA if away or home WOBA if home
- we can also do their WOBAs vs Lefties if vs Lefty or Righties if vs Righty

we can weight the WOBAs - because we have 2020 and 2021 --> maybe to start just do (2020 * 1) and (2021 * 1.5)

so example so far:
    pitcher: 
        2020 Home WOBA + (2021 Home WOBA * 1.5)
        Last 14 Days WOBA --> just add this in as well
        (((2020 Lefty WOBA * num L) + (2020 Righty WOBA * num R)) / 9) + (((2021 Lefty WOBA * num L) + (2021 Righty WOBA * num R)) / 9) * 1.5
        add these
        can compare the two pitchers now - the lower one would be better 
    batter:
        2020 Away WOBA + (2021 Away WOBA * 1.5)
        2020 vs Righty WOBA + (2021 Righty WOBA * 1.5)
        - add this up for all players on the team and divide by 9 --> if a batter doesnt have these for whatever reason just give the average? 
        can compare the two lineups now - the higher would be better
